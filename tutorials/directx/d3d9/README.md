# Direct3D 9

DirectX version 9, and one of its component - Direct3D9, was introduced by Microsoft in 2002. This API still might be interested for two reasons:

* Direct3D9 the last Direct3D API with Fixed Vertex Declaration where the application may define the format of vertexes in the pipeline. All next releases of Direct3D use shading mode and shader programs run on GPU.
* All version of Microsoft Windows starting from Windows XP SP2 support Direct3D9 for the backward compatibility.
* Special version of Direct3D9 (dxlevel 98 which is the special build of DirectX 9.0c) is using inside of the second generation of Xbox consoles - Xbox 360. This is mostly historical interest but still might be useful.

# Android Game Activity

Game Activity is a special Jetpack library designed to make the processing of system commands, input events and the text input easier for the C++ part of the application. Game Activity descendants from the [Native Activity](../001_native_activity/README.md), however it also contains some of the functionality to wrap-up more often usable functions.

All next tutorials will use Game Activity to communicate with the operation system.

> Comparing to the fully native code Game Activity requires the Java/Kotlin code and the special Activity descendant from the com.google.androidgamesdk.GameActivity to work.

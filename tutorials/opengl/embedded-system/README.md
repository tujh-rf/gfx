# OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES or GLES)

Subset of OpenGL API.

GLES is designed for embedded systems like smartphones, tablet computers, video game consoles and PDAs.

GLES 1.0 (released July 2003) is drawn up against the OpenGL 1.3 specification, GLES 1.1 is defined relative to the OpenGL 1.5 specification and GLES 2.0 is defined relative to the OpenGL 2.0 specification.

GLES specifications 3.0-3.2 are backward compatible with GLES 2.0 and partially compatible with WebGL 2.0 but all of them are next generations of each other with porting of new features from OpenGL 3.0-4.6 but not a porting of Modern OpenGL standards to the embedded platforms.
Because of that OpenGL ES SL (shading language) is different from the OpenGL SL.

> All OpenGL ES tutorials are made as independent Android application.

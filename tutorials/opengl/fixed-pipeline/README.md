# OpenGL with Fixed Functional Pipeline

The term **Fixed Functional Pipeline** commonly refers to the set of configurable processing state presets in older versions of OpenGL that has been replaced by **Shaders**.

The purpose of the OpenGL is to expose features of the underlying graphics hardware to application developers.

OpenGL 3.0 was the last revision of the specification which fully supported both **fixed** and **programmable** functionality. Even so, most hardware since the OpenGL 2.0 generation lacked the actual fixed-function hardware. Instead, fixed-function processes are emulated with shaders build by the system.

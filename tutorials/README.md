# Tutorials

In this folder is possible to find a step-by-step tutorials how to start using different graphical APIs.

* [OpenGL](opengl/README.md)
* [Vulkan](vulkan/README.md)
* DirectX
* Metal

> Tutorials do not follow best practice of the C/C++ programming languages because the main target is to show how to use API and not how to use C++. In this case was easier to use mix of C and C++ in the tutorials but more easy to understand for beginners.
